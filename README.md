# Pathfinding Visualizer

This was developed as a way to visualize the differences in various pathfinding and maze generation algorithms. With this project, I used React, a popular JavaScript framework to develop a fully responsive webpage that allows the user to select different maze generation and pathfinding algorithms and see the steps they take when searching. You can view this project [here](https://daniel-hinz.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/).

### Installation
The user is able download and run this application by navigating to the directory they wish to download it and running the following commands:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Hinz/Pathfinding-Visualizer-React.git
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage
With this project the user is able to visualize the differences in the Dijkstras, A*, Breadth First, and Depth First searching algorithms. In addition, there is also added functionality to generate mazes with Recursive Divison, Recursive Backtracking, and Random Generation. The user can select a maze and searching algorithm from the dropdowns located in the header and when the user hits search, you can see the differences in the searching algorithms. In addition, the user is able to reposition the start and end nodes, as well as draw and remove barriers by clicking/dragging their mouse on the grid.
