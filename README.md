# Pathfinding Visualizer

This was developed as a way to visualize the differences in various pathfinding and maze generation algorithms. With this project, I used React, a popular JavaScript framework to develop a fully responsive webpage that allows the user to select different maze generation and pathfinding algorithms and see the steps they take when searching. You can view this project [here](https://daniel-hinz.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/).
